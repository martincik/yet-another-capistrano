= Yet Another Capistrano
Author: Ladislav Martincik (ladislav.martincik@gmail.com)

Motivation:

- Have possibility to 'easily' implement different deploy/server workflows
 + Example:
   workflow do
     concurrence :roles => [:app] do
       # Upload source to all servers 
     end
     
     sequence :roles => [:db] do 
       # Migrate database
     end
     
     sequence :roles => [:app] do
       # Restart server one by one
     end
   end

- Separate task definition from workflow definition
  + workflow definition executes tasks
  + tasks are always sequential
    - basic bash commands
    - sudo commands
  + Example:
    
    task :ls_al do 
      sudo 'ls -al /root' do |input|
        push 'password' if input ~= /Password:/
      end
      
      run 'pwd; ls -al'
    end

- Separation of data from logic
  + Configuration settings should be on different place than workflow
   * Configuration files can be defined as YAML or pure Ruby (for dynamics)
